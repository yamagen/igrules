### Tasuki-gake Effect

Immediate grammar and adjustment grammar are typically used in distinct contexts:

- Immediate grammar is used in spontaneous, context-dependent utterances such as casual conversation or emotional reaction.
- Adjustment grammar is used in pre-structured, composed contexts such as formal speeches, letters, or ceremonial language.

However, when these are **used across their typical boundaries**, a special rhetorical effect arises. This is referred to as the _Tasuki-gake Effect_ (cross-band effect).

- When immediate grammar is used in adjustment contexts (e.g., novels, public speeches), it brings liveliness, immediacy, and a natural tone to the expression.
- When adjustment grammar is used in immediate contexts (e.g., face-to-face conversation), it adds politeness, deliberateness, and a sense of formality or ritual.

This effect is the result of crossing the boundary between grammar types and their typical usage contexts, producing expressive contrasts and heightened rhetorical impact.
