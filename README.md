**igrules** is a project that documents permissibility rules for Immediate Grammar in a bilingual format (Japanese and English).

## üß≠ Overview

This repository documents expression patterns that are typically considered unacceptable in phrase structure grammar (adjustive grammar), but are fully natural and functional within immediate grammar, based on real-time speech phenomena.

## üîç Intended Uses

- Japanese learners: Searching for examples of immediate and natural speech
- Linguists: Describing and organizing syntactic constraints
- Developers: Applications in rule-based natural language processing (NLP) and interpreters
- Educators: Introducing as a variation of grammar
